## 1.0.0 (January 10th, 2025)

- Initial Release, taking various coding standards configs from linchpin projects, getting inspiration from some larger agencies and plugin developers in the WordPress community. We don't need to be as extensive so our requirements primarily match that of the baseline WordPress coding standards and VIP with some minor opinions from our engineering team.
